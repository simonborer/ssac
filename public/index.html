				<h2>What is accessibility?</h2>
				<p><strong>Accessibility</strong> is a recognition that different people face different social barriers, and that we have a responsibility to work together to remove those barriers wherever possible.</p>
				<p><strong>Web accessibility</strong> is about meeting standards and using specific techniques in design, content and development so that your website is accessible to people with a range of physical and cognitive challenges.</p>
				<p>Laws enforcing web accessibility as a human right are in effect in most major markets, including Canada, the U.S., and the E.U.</p>

			<div class="section" id="why">
				<h2>Why be accessible?</h2>
				<p>The easiest answer is "it's the law".</p>
				<p>But most people aren't aware of the benefits of making your web content accessible. The simple fact is that most of "being accessible" is simply a matter of making your website's code respect web standards. Thanks to the <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_curb_cut_effect">curb cut effect</a>, your website will work on more browsers and devices, and will be easier to use for all your customers.</p>
				<p>One of your most important customers is Google - meeting web standards means improved SEO!</p>

				<h2>Can't I just install this plugin?</h2>
				<p>While there are some very good tools for auditing & enhancing your accessibility, a large number of accessibility techniques are meant to provide context for visually impaired users that isn't evident in the code or content. For a simple example, a plugin can tell you that an image needs alternative text, but it can't tell you what that alternative text should be.</p>
